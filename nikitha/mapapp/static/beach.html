        <h2>KAPPIL BEACH</h2>
        <h3>Kappil Beach is one of the most beautiful and peaceful beaches near Varkala, located about 7 km north of Varkala town in Kerala. It is famous for its unique natural beauty, where the Arabian Sea and the Edava–Nadayara Backwaters run parallel to each other. This creates a stunning landscape that you won't find in many other places in Kerala.</h3>
